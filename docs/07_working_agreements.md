# Working Agreements (How we build)

- Chats are disposable; docs are authoritative.
- Each chat focuses on one task only.
- Any important decision gets recorded in /docs/06_decision_log.md
- Any open question goes in /docs/08_current_task.md or a dedicated section.
- Prefer small PR-sized changes.
